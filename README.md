**Current features:**

- Load Directories and display/edit associated text files in Gallery tab/widget

- Load Directories with blank text fields meant for populating with Auto-Captions once BLIP-2 is integrated

- Image selection (Multi-Select images functionality)

- Tag panel (collapsible tag panel with text field to add/create new tag buttons and also delete tag buttons if needed)

- Tag Buttons (functions to create tag buttons and functions to append current text/captions to selected images when clicking a tag button)

- Persistent Tag buttons (user created tags persist from session to session unless deleted)

- Sort/Filter function (Sort/Filter by tags with displayed images & text being updated in the window to display only the images/texts associated with the tag being searched/filtered for)

- Category/Collections Pane/Panel & Functions (Custom categories/collections pane to create new directories/dataset folders to copy selected files into for an easy way to mix n match and create new datasets)

- Tag Sharing (a text file is created in your root folder housing all user custom tags, this text file acts as your tag button database but also allows easy sharing of user made tags)

- BLIP-2 integration (Integrate Blip-2 and Blip-2 settings to auto generate captions to text fields and save generated captions to new text files named after target images) (CPU Only based currently)

- Image Editing (Added an Image Editing Widget powered by OpenCV/cv2 for image editing, current image editing features are rotation and resizing, plan to add more soon)

- Settings (Added a settings widget to select Default-Light, or Dark theme. NOTE: Do not choose "Light" it causes crash, choos "Default" if changing back to Light mode)


**To do list:**

- [ ] **Image Editing suite** (complete Image Editing widget with batch functions to edit/manage/delete/crop/resize/adjust brightness/contrast/hue/color/etc)
