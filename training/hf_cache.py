"""Cache-first HuggingFace loading — offline once warm.

`from_pretrained(repo_id)` phones the Hub for an etag check on EVERY call, even when the files
are fully cached — so a machine with flaky or no internet can't start training (or mid-run
auto-recaption) despite having every byte on disk (issue #26). Asking for the cache first makes
the network a first-run-only event: hit the local cache, and only fall back to the Hub when
something is genuinely missing. Also shaves the round-trip off every warm start.

`local_files_only=True` alone is not enough for a large-vocabulary tokenizer (every Qwen one): since
transformers 4.57 its loader asks the Hub whether the repo is a Mistral model (`model_info`) unless the
source is a local directory — so a cached Qwen tokenizer still failed offline (#174). The cached
snapshot's own folder is a local directory, so it is loaded from there first.
