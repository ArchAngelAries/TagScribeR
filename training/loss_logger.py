"""Passive per-image loss logger (experiment/per-image-loss-logger).

Records, per training step, the image trained on, the timestep it drew, and the loss — so we can
study whether per-image loss *trajectories* (timestep-normalized) reveal image difficulty, outliers,
or a better training order/weighting. This is PURELY OBSERVATIONAL: it never touches gradients, the
learning rate, sampling, or ordering. It only writes a log.

Why timestep matters: a diffusion step's loss is dominated by the *random timestep* drawn that step
(loss at t≈0.95 is structurally huge vs t≈0.2), so raw per-image loss mostly ranks the dice roll,
not the image. We log the raw loss AND the timestep, plus a convenience residual against a running
per-timestep-bucket mean, so the intrinsic "harder/easier than average at this noise level" signal
can be recovered. The raw JSONL is the source of truth; do the real normalization offline.

Enable by setting the env var TAGSCRIBER_PERIMAGE_LOSS_LOG=1 before launching training (the trainer
subprocess inherits it). Off by default → zero cost. Writes:
  <output_dir>/loss_log/per_image_loss.jsonl   — one JSON line per image-step

True per-image granularity needs batch size 1 (each step = one image), which is the Krea 2 /
typical LoRA default. For B>1 the step loss is the batch mean; we log it against the joined keys
and record the batch size so analysis can skip those.

class PerImageLossWatch:
    """Online per-image difficulty watcher — the actionable layer on top of the passive logger.

    Two GUI-toggleable behaviours share this one class:
      * problem-image detection (`write_jsonl` / always-on analytics): at each epoch boundary,
        classifies every image as STUCK (high residual, not descending — likely outlier/mislabel),
        LEARNING (high but descending — hard-but-good), or easy, logs stuck images to the console,
        and writes <output_dir>/loss_log/problem_images.json.
      * per-image adaptive LR (`apply_lr=True`): additionally emits a per-image loss multiplier —
        throttle STUCK images (default x0.5) so one bad image can't keep yanking the weights, give
        healthy/learned ones a gentle boost (default x1.1), leave hard-but-learning alone. At batch
        size 1, scaling the step's loss IS a per-image LR. Guardrails: no action during the warmup
        epochs (the trend needs data), the healthy x1.1 is the ONLY boost (every problem verdict
        reduces), and batch size > 1 disables scaling entirely (a batch mean isn't a per-image
        signal).

    Normalization matches the validated offline analyzer: residuals are recomputed at every epoch
    boundary against the CURRENT per-timestep-bucket means over the whole run so far — never the
    order-dependent live running mean (first sample per bucket would always read as residual 0).
    Raw records are kept in memory; a few thousand (key, epoch, bucket, loss) tuples is trivial.
