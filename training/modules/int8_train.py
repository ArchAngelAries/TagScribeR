"""INT8 (W8A8) matmul for a FROZEN training base — differentiable, unlike modules/int8.py.

modules/int8.py runs int8 under no_grad for previews. Training needs a gradient path: the LoRA
sits downstream of these Linears, so grad must flow *through* the frozen base to reach it.

Two things make this cheaper and safer here than a general W8A8 implementation:

1. **The base is frozen.** We never need grad w.r.t. the weight — only w.r.t. the input. Weight
   gradients are where int8 quantisation does the most damage, and we simply don't compute them.

2. **Gradient checkpointing is on by default**, so the forward runs TWICE per step (once
   forward, once recomputed inside backward). An int8 forward therefore covers two thirds of
   the matmul work even if the backward stays in bf16.

Hence `grad_mode`:
    "bf16"  – int8 forward, bf16 backward. Gradients are exact; ~2/3 of the win. Default.
    "int8"  – both quantised (what OneTrainer does). Faster, and the accuracy question is real:
              gradients have a far wider dynamic range than weights, and small updates are
              exactly what per-image LR and fine-tuning depend on.

The backward's weight scale is per-output-channel, and the backward reduces OVER that axis, so
it cannot be factored out after the matmul. It is folded into grad_output *before* quantising
instead — cheap, and exact.

Measured at Krea 2's main shape (M=1024, K=N=6144), RTX 5090:
    dequant + bf16 matmul (current)   0.767 ms
    _int_mm + activation quant        0.224 ms
