"""4-bit (NF4) base quantization for the frozen Klein 9B DiT — opt-in low-VRAM mode.

Quantizes the frozen base-block Linear weights to NF4 (bitsandbytes), roughly
halving DiT residency (~9.6 GB fp8 → ~5.6 GB) so a full 9B LoRA fits on an
10–12 GB card with no block swap (the gap fp8's ~14 GB training can't reach). The
trainable LoRA still runs in bf16 on top —
this is QLoRA's recipe applied to a diffusion DiT.

Design mirrors modules/fp8.py: we keep each `nn.Linear` (so LoRA targeting by
module path is unchanged) and monkey-patch its `forward` to dequantize NF4 → bf16
per matmul. Unlike the fp8 `_scaled_mm` path, the forward here is plain
`dequantize_nf4` + `F.linear` — standard autograd, no custom Function — so it
composes cleanly with gradient checkpointing (no saved-tensor fragility).

Source-agnostic: quantizes from whatever the loaded base is. An fp8 base is
dequantized fp8 → bf16 first, then NF4 (fp8→NF4 is slightly lossier — double
quantization); a bf16 base goes straight to NF4 (cleaner, closer to QLoRA's
native error). Either way the result is a 4-bit resident base.
