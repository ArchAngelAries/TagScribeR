# Changes for TagScribeR: env var prefix TAGSCRIBER_ (SDPA_BACKEND, SDPA_TRAIN_MARGIN, CUDNN_BENCHMARK); the cuDNN
# probe is skipped for tensors that are not on a GPU (`sdpa_backend_ctx(device_type=...)`), so CPU tests never touch the
# card; otherwise unchanged.
"""Which SDPA backend to use, and when — one decision, shared by every attention site.

cuDNN's SDPA kernel is faster than PyTorch's default choice for these shapes — but it builds a
plan the first time it sees each shape, and that build is expensive. Measured on the REAL
INT8 Krea 2 model, real cached batches, fwd+bwd+optimizer (RTX 5090):

                      first sight    steady state    one-time, 36 shapes
    default backend     582.2 ms       572.2 ms            0.4 s
    cuDNN              1829.9 ms       536.6 ms           46.6 s

So cuDNN is ~6% FASTER per step once warm, and costs ~1.3 s per distinct shape to get there.
Which one wins is purely a question of how many steps amortize that:

    saves 37 ms/step, costs 46.6 s once  ->  breaks even near 1260 steps

Inference is the clear case FOR it: one resolution held for a whole render, so the plan is built
once and reused for every step of every image.

    Krea 2 1024 preview   5.15 s -> 4.40 s
    Klein  1024 preview   3.01 s -> 2.74 s

Training is the ambiguous case. On a 36-image set that break-even lands around 35 epochs; shorter
runs lose, longer runs win by up to ~6%. The default backend is chosen for training because it is
the one that cannot lose, not because cuDNN is bad — TAGSCRIBER_SDPA_BACKEND=cudnn is there for anyone
doing long runs. Note the cost scales with the number of DISTINCT shapes, which the attention trim
inflates (each caption's token count becomes part of the sequence length — 30 shapes from 36
images); TAGSCRIBER_ATTN_TRIM=0 trades compute for far fewer shapes.

Two earlier conclusions here were WRONG and are corrected above: that cuDNN is ~2x slower for
training (it was a short-benchmark artifact — 46.6 s of plan building charged against 108 steps),
and that cudnn.benchmark is worth 68x (it makes no measurable difference at all: 66.0 s of plan
building with it off vs 65.9 s on, 535.1 vs 536.6 ms/step steady).

`torch.is_grad_enabled()` is the switch because it tracks that distinction exactly: False under
no_grad (previews, Royale, Repair Studio, Explorer, sampling — one resolution held for a whole
render) and True in a training step, including inside a gradient-checkpoint recompute.

Numerically equivalent to bf16 tolerance (rel-err ~5e-4, masked or not). Probed once; if the
kernel is unavailable this is a no-op. TAGSCRIBER_SDPA_BACKEND=default|cudnn overrides.

Used by the DiT attention paths (Krea 2 and Klein, head_dim 128). The VAE attention blocks are
deliberately left alone: they run single-head with head_dim = channels, which cuDNN cannot take
at all, so wrapping them would buy nothing.
