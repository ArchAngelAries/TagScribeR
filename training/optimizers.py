# Changes for TagScribeR: import path of the vendored Automagic v3; the Krea 2 per-family param grouping is kept for
# when that family arrives (T4). Catalog, LR warnings and the AdamW fallback are unchanged.
"""Optimizer selection, shared by the trainers.

Krea 2 hardcoded `bnb.optim.AdamW8bit` — a good default, but the only choice, which is the one
place the community comparison against OneTrainer (~40 optimizers) landed a fair hit.

Two things matter for a LoRA and pull against the "more optimizers is better" instinct:

* **Optimizer state is tiny here.** Krea 2 trains 264 small factors, so AdamW's two moments cost
  ~tens of MB against a 13-19 GB base. Choosing an 8-bit or factored optimizer to save memory is
  nearly pointless — the base dominates. What the choice actually buys is *update behaviour*.
* **Learning rates are not comparable across families.** Lion's update is a sign, so it wants
  roughly a tenth of AdamW's LR. Handing someone a dropdown without saying that is how you
  produce a fried LoRA and a bug report, so `create_optimizer` warns loudly on the record when
  the LR looks wrong for the family. (Self-tuning families — Prodigy, CAME, Adafactor — were
  removed for exactly this class of failure; see the note above _CATALOG.)

Free-form `module.path.ClassName` is accepted too, so a user who pip-installs something exotic
does not need a Fizgig release to use it.
